/**
 * When a user is first identified in your system (e.g. when they sign up or login), call the Identify method to send
 * Threads the user's information. This should include the user-id, email address, and any other user-specific data you have,
 * such as his or her name, address, or current service plan. You may call Identify as often as you like,
 * adding or changing user traits as needed.
 * <p>
 * After the user has been identified, call Track to track application-specific events such as "Signed Up,"
 * "Upgraded Plan," or "Used Feature Foo." You can include additional event properties as needed, such as the details of
 * the plan the user has upgraded to, the specifics of the feature they used, and so on.
 * <p>
 * Page is used to record web page views for a user.
 * <p>
 * Remove can be used to remove users from Threads. Once they have been removed, no more workflows will trigger for them,
 * and any data stored for the user will be unavailable.
 * <p>
 * All data sent to Threads via the API should be encoded as UTF-8.
